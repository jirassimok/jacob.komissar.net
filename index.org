* About

This page is meant to show some of my previous work as a supplement to my
resume, which is most likely how you found this page.

* Open Source

** Python Typeshed

I [[gh:python/typeshed/pull/3451][updated and restructured]] the type stubs for
Python's socket module. I added missing constants and methods (as of Python
3.8), and improved the module's maintainability by organizing the type stubs to
follow the documentation.

** [[github:presto-manager][Presto Manager]]

This was my intern project at Teradata in summer 2017, developed with two other
interns to simplify the management of Presto's distributed system.

* Personal Projects

**  [[github:dir2pdf][dir2pdf]]

A Python program that converts a directory of images to a multi-page PDF. I
wrote it for a friend who writes comics. This program is
[[https://pypi.org/project/dir2pdf/][available on PyPI]].

** [[github:SchedulerTranslator][WPI Scheduler Translator]]

When WPI replaced their schedule-planning tool (now at
[[https://planner.wpi.edu][planner.wpi.edu]]) with a newer, clunkier tool, I set
out to translate the JSON data from the new tool into the XML format for the old
one. This was my first personal project, conducted before I had any significant
software development experience.

News of this reached the academic advising office, and some time after I met
with them, the original website was brought back online.

** [[github:wheel-of-time][Wheel of Time]]

This simple Emacs package implements the time-scrolling functionality mentioned
by [[https://xkcd.com/1806/][this xkcd]].

* Coursework

These are projects that I completed for various courses at WPI. Some of the
GitHub repositories have randomly-generated names to make them harder to
identify. Courses for which I do not have code on GitHub are not listed.

** [[github:SoftEng-2017][Software Engineering]]

In this class, I worked as Assistant Lead Software Engineer in a team of 10
students to develop an application to allow users to navigate in hospitals.  I
learned the basics of agile development and application design, which has
influenced most programs I have written since.

** Computer Graphics

In this class, I learned about the OpenGL graphics pipeline via WebGL. This
course was my first experience with serious JavaScript programming.

- *[[jirassimok:animated-octo-funicular][Mesh Display Tool]]*
  ([[github:animated-octo-funicular][source]]): This tool allows the
  display and limited animation of a subset of PLY files, such as those found
  [[github:animated-octo-funicular/tree/master/sample-files][here]].
- *[[jirassimok:fictional-giggle][Mobile Animation]]*
  ([[github:fictional-giggle][source]]): This animation demonstrates textures,
  hierarchical modeling, basic lighting models, and basic reflection and
  refraction (note that the textures shown with reflection and refraction are
  intentionally different from the textures shown on the walls).

** Data Visualization

In this course, I learned visualization techniques, particularly using
[[https://d3js.org][D3.js]]. The GitHub repositories for the course are mostly
private, but my projects can be viewed on GitHub Pages.

- *A Classic Experiment* ([[jirassimok:03-Experiment/gh/quiz.html][experiment]],
  [[jirassimok:03-Experiment][report]]):
  A variation on [[doi:10.2307/2288400][this visualization experiment]],
  influenced by [[doi:10.1111/cgf.12888][this study]]. This experiment aimed to
  use the experiment's technique to study how data is percieved in variations on
  pie charts, as discussed in the study.
- *[[jirassimok:02-DataVis-10ways][10 Ways]]:* A demonstration of the same simple
  chart in 10 different visualization programs, including discussion of each
  tool.
